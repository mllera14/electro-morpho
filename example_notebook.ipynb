    "\n",
    "This is an example notebook detailing the functions currently contained in this module for Multi-Output (or Multi-Task) Regression. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Network structure discovery in continuous domains for modeling relations and feature selection.\n",
    "2. Combine several sampled networks to create an empirical approximation of the posterior distribution over network structures. This allows for a more robust estimation, especially when few samples are available.\n",
    "3. Use of the learned structure to fit a Multi-Task Regression model that can perform regression over several target variables simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of this model is the analysis and prediction of Morphological and Electrophysiological variables of neurons by learning their relations from experimental data."
